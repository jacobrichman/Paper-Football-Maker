Paper-Football is a simple game where you take triangle shaped pieces of paper and try to flick it with your finger in-between the other personâ€™s fingers like a football field goal. The problem is that these "footballs" never come out the right size or shape and there's always something slightly off about each one. So, I built a site to make custom paper footballs and even add images.
